### Usage

These script are used to generate twice yearly reports for the Provincial Ground Water Observation Network (PGOWN). Reports rely on raw data provided by Jillian Kelly

There are four core scripts that are required for the analysis and to produce the report, they need to be run in order:

-   01\_load.R
-   02\_clean.R
-   03\_outputs.R
-   gwater-.Rmd

#### Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r

```
